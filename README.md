# Multifox

Development has stopped due to
[deprecation of XPCOM extensions](https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2015/08/21/the-future-of-developing-firefox-add-ons/).

However, Mozilla has implemented a very similar feature in the testing versions of Firefox (a.k.a. Nightly). [Container Tabs](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Contextual_Identity_Project/Containers) are "contextual identities." There is a pre-set and pre-named list of the containers, but they have the same effect as MultiFox, and they officially will work with Firefox (even e10s). Read more details on the Mozilla [blog post](https://blog.mozilla.org/tanvi/2016/06/16/contextual-identities-on-the-web/) or [Mozilla Wiki page](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Contextual_Identity_Project/Containers).
